## Distance test

```
Analyze the image to: 1) count the number of pedestrians on the road ahead, 2) estimate their distances in meters, and 3) identify whether each pedestrian is moving or stationary, and indicate their direction of movement if moving.

| LLaVa                         | It's not possible for me to provide an accurate count of pedestrians from this image, as they  may be too small or obscured by objects like cars and trees. Additionally, due to the  resolution and angle of the photo, it's challenging to accurately estimate distances and directions of people on the road.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Molmo                         | There is one pedestrian visible in the image. They are standing in the middle of the road, which appears to be a one-way street. The person is stationary, not moving. To estimate the distance, I'd say they're approximately 30-40 meters away. They are facing away from the viewer, looking in the direction of the yellow building in the background.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| llama-3.2-vision-11B          | The image shows a road with a pedestrian crossing in the distance. The road is wide enough for two lanes of traffic, with a sidewalk on either side. There are several cars parked along the side of the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk.<br><br>To answer the questions:<br><br>1. Count the number of pedestrians on the road ahead:<br><br>There are no pedestrians on the road ahead. However, there are two pedestrians visible on the sidewalk in the distance, one walking towards the camera and the other walking away from it.<br><br>2.

The pedestrian walking towards the camera is moving towards the right side of the image, while the pedestrian walking away from the camera is moving towards the left side of the image.<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is:<br><br>There are 2 pedestrians on the road ahead, with distances of approximately 20-25 meters and 30-35 meters respectively.
